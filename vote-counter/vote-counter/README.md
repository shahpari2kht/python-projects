# Vote Counter

This project counts votes for two candidates. The user enters the names and number of votes, and the program determines the winner (or if itâ€™s a tie).

## What I learned
- How to use `input()` and `int()` for getting and converting user input
- Using if-else statements for decision making
- Comparing variables

## Example
Enter name of candidate 1: Alice
Enter votes for Alice: 55
Enter name of candidate 2: Bob
Enter votes for Bob: 44
Alice wins!
