# Age Classifier

This is a very simple Python project that asks the user for their age and classifies them as a "khordsal" (meaning "toddler" in Persian) if their age is between 0 and 6.

## ðŸ§  What I learned:
- How to take user input in Python
- How to use conditional statements (`if`)
- How to convert input to an integer with `int()`
- How to run a simple program from the terminal

## ðŸ§ª Example:

```bash
Enter your age: 4
khordsal
